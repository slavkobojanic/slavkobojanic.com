    <h2>About myself</h2>
    <p>I'm a very interesting person. I'm from Wollongong, NSW, but no longer live there and am somewhere in Sydney. I graduated from the University of Wollongong and I graduated with an OK mark. I enjoy writing the web softwares such as TypeScript and React and think they are very fun.</p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <h3>Canva, 2019 - present</h3>
    <p>I've been working at Canva for about two years now building out the App Store, specifically working on perfecting the user experience. I think that i've achieved my goal in perfecting it but will continue to perfect it til I get bored, and then maybe i'll re-write it in some new trendy framework (Svelte perhaps?). I do lots of cool stuff here but i'm not going to tell you because it's a top government secret.</p>
    <h3>QPS Benchmarking, 2018 - 2019</h3>
    <p>I helped QPS Benchmarking build out their patient/employee reporting and statistic system front-ends for a bit of software used by plenty of aged-care service providers. I dabbled in JS+React, and some Py+Django here. This was neat and I learnt a good bit about JS here.</h3>
    <h3>ViVO Digital, 2017 (?) - 2018</h3>
    <p>I made WordPress websites here. Making WordPress websites isn't so fun.</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <h3>University of Wollongong</h3>
    <h4>Bachelor of Information Technology, GPA was pretty close to a distinction</h4>
    <p>I learnt a lot about Java and C++, CS theory, and mathematicky stuff, which greatly prepared me for writing funky React components in the future.</p>
